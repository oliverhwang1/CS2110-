/** Recitation 03: Practice with exceptions. */

/* This problem set contains five problems, outlined below. When you or your
 * group has completed them, submit this file to the CMS for recitation 03.
 *
 * The purpose of this problem set is for you to practice with exception handling.
 * As long as this is a good attempt, with most things right, you get 100%.
 * Please do this with one or two other people if possible. You learn when you
 * discuss with others.
 *
 *    For an in-person recitation, work as best as you can with 1 or 2 other people.
 *    For an online recitation, do try to work with one or two other students, sharing
 *    screens, chatting, communicating whichever way you feel is most suitable for you.
 *
 * If you have a question, ask the TA or the people around you or other students in
 * your zoom meeting.
 *
 * Go ahead! Discuss things with others.
 *
 * Complete and submit before the end of the recitation, if at all possible!
 *
 * Some of these questions are mechanical, asking for a definition or something like that.
 * Some ask you to write code or execute a method call. In that case, itâ€™s best to do it in
 * Eclipse or JShell to check your work. You can look at notes or a book, get on the internet
 * and read the exception-handling webpage, watch the videos, google something, whatever.
 *
 *
 *
 * 1. Describe part of the Throwable Hierarchy (see below).
 * Throwable
 *  Exception
 *      RuntimeException
 *  Error
 *
 *
 * 2. Complete method min, given below. It doesn't throw the IllegalArgumentException
 * it is supposed to throw, according to the specification. Fix that.
 *
 * 3. In Method main, there is a commented-out call on method min.
 * Uncomment it and put the call in a try-statement that catches an IllegalArgumentException;
 * if an IllegalArgumentException is thrown, it should print "Caught an IllegalArgumentException".
 * Naturally, method main should continue to execute after that.
 *
 * 4. Fix procedure printProduct so that if a NumberFormatException is thrown
 * by a call on parseInt, the number 1 is used. There are two such calls, so
 * two try-statements will be needed.
 *
 * 5. Fix procedure printProduct so that if the user types the characters  DONE ,
 * the method terminates (executes a return statement).
 *
 * ================================
 * Here's Question 1.
 * We use indentation to describe subclass hierarchy. For example, this:
 *
 *      Animal
 *         Dog
 *           Collie
 *         Cat
 *
 * indicates that classes Dog and Cat are subclasses of class Animal and
 * class Collie is a subclass of Dog.
 *
 * Below, write part of the hierarchy of Throwable objects.
 * It should include classes Throwable, Error, Exception, and at least two
 * subclasses of Error and two subclasses of Exception. You can do more but
 * you don't have to.
 *
 *
 *Throwable
 *  Exception
 *      RuntimeException
 *  Error
 *
 *
